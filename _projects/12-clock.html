	In the summer after first year, I worked on exchange at the National University of Singapore. There, I worked closely with the Singapore Science Center creating demos and experiments for students. The demos were designed to be low-cost and easy to replicate.

	One of the projects I made was a completely functional mechanical clock that could be laser cut from a single piece of acrylic sheet. A video of a prototype is below.

	The clock was designed in autocad and made with a laser cutter. I also got to work with 3D printers. Other experiments I built included easy to build vacuum chambers and a replica of the classic drinking bird.
