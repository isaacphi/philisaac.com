<div class="text">
	This engineering design course is known as the bane of the engineering science program at U of T, and with good reason. This one course consumes more time than the other 5 equally weighted courses we take at the same time.
</div>

<div class="text">
	the goal
</div>

<div class="text">
	Work in a team of three to design and build a fully functional autonomous robot capable  of packaging ping pong balls. More specifically:<br/><br/>
	&bull; Propose a complete design for the robot<br/>
	&bull; Justify all design decisions with research, simulations, prototypes.<br/>
	&bull; Follow sound engineering design and managerial frameworks<br/>
	&bull; Each member individually completes one of: mechanical, electrical, or software subsystem<br/>
	&bull; Integration of subsystems<br/>
	&bull; Complete documentation<br/>
</div>

<div class="text">
	Ok, doesn't sound that bad. Keep in mind though that this was second year and being told to simply build a robot was pretty intimidating. Let's  look at my qualifications at the time: <br/><br/>
	&bull; Can solve abstract circuit problems that one would never encounter in practice <br/>
	&bull; Can solve abstract programming problems that one would never encounter in practice <br/>
	&bull; Good at math <br/>
</div>

<div class="text">
	We were more or less left on our own, which felt terrible at the time. In hindsight it may have been the best learning experience I had at school. I'm very greatful that we had a the chance at a design course and some hands on work in only second year.

	My role was to program a <a href="https://www.microchip.com/ParamChartSearch/Chart.aspx?branchID=1004">PIC microcontroller</a> in assembly and interface it with sensors. I helped out with the circuits too. Trolling through that 400 page PIC manual (and many others) definitly did me good. It turns out that the task was completeable in the end. We just had to get in the mindset of teaching ourselves and powering through what seemed to be impossible amounts of work.

	It was remarkable to see

	Which was one of my first sketches about a mechanism, end up as part of a full fledged functional machine:

<div class="text">
	Looking at a robot project back when I knew nothing about anything was an intimidating thing. So were 400 page manuals about assembly code that are written for professionals in industry. But somehow we got through.
</div>

<div class="text">
	Now when I look at some challenge, I'm 100% sure I can do it if I put my mind to it. This is one of the reasons I got more into software outside of school after this project.

<div class="text">
	Watching the video above makes me cringe for two reasons. The first being the memories of the all nighters. The second being the desire to fix up everything that I realize in hindsight we did terribly wrong. I would definitely have made a few decisions differently.

<div class="text">
	I have to thank my great team Carson Clark and Thomas Dingle.
