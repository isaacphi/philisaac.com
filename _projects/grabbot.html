	I entered a two day intensive robotics hackathon in winter 2014. We built a small robot where a claw was controlled with gesture recognition. It would mimic the movements of your hand and close its claw when you grabbed.

	The robot consisted of servo motors controlled by an arduino, which recieved its commands from a python script over serial. A LeapMotion controller was used for gesture recognition.
