	The poster below is for a planter I designed for urban gardening with a group of peers for a design course at U of T. It was made for the non-profit group <a href="http://tppgta.blogspot.ca/">The Permaculture Project GTA</a> (TPPGTA).

<div class="text">
	The planter is designed to be used on urban rooftops, which go mostly unutilized in urban environments. It features an easy irrigation system and shelters plants in order to extend the viable growing season. The aim was to provide a productive use for urban rooftops and make alternative food sources more accessible.
