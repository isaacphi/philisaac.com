  My first exposure to programming was through scientific data processing though studying physics. As much as I enjoyed this, it was a very misleading picture of what programming can be. As soon as I discovered programming for the web, I was captivated. I don't think it was web programming that I enjoyed so much as simply being able to get instant, visual feedback on what you make. I think this also what later drew me to robotics.

  I originally taught myself web programming as a creative outlet for design as a break from the technically heavy programming I was doing for school. I first learned by creating an extremely basic version of this site, years ago.

<div class="caption">First version of this website. Very embarrassing.</div>

  The first version used raw html and css, and loads of interactivity using javascript. I quickly learned the value of tools such as sass and javascript libraries.

<div class="caption">Version 2. I think I always had a thing for slashes along the sides of my site.</div>

  After this, the internet became obsessed with responsive design so I had to adapt. I also decided to overengineer my site and host it on <a href="http://www.openshift.com">openshift</a> with django as a backend in order to learn to use these technologies.

  The above site is still available at <a href="http://stwgtg-isaacphi.rhcloud.com">stwgtg-isaacphi.rhcloud.com</a> if you're curious. I finally decided that this site should be a little more practical so I am now hosting it on AWS and generating the static site with jekyll.

  What I learned about django played a huge part in the time I spent with <a href="http://www.PheedLoop.com">PheedLoop</a>. PheedLoop is a company that I co-founded while still studying at the University of Toronto. PheedLoop is an all-in-one management and engagement web software suite for conference organizers, speakers, and attendees. It is continuing to grow and serve hundreds of conferences. I worked on every aspect of the company and website, but spent the most time on the organizer's dashboard.

  I continue to enjoy building websites including this one. Recently I also made a portfolio site for <a href="http://www.masonarts.ca">masonarts</a>.
