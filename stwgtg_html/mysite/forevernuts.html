		After learning how to make circuits though working on <a href="/project/balle">Ball-E</a>, I wanted to put my skills to use on something fun and creative. Even though I’m no good at guitar, I love it and wanted to re-create a classic effects pedal.

		The arbiter fuzz face is a classic and simple fuzz/distortion pedal and turns out to have quite a simple design. At its core, it consists of just two PNP transistors. The first is a clean amplifier and the second saturates or clips the output, creating a fuzz or distortion effect. The extent to which the output is controlled by a potentiometer.

		Since this was one of the first circuits I made myself by hand, it’s not all that pretty. I’m looking forward to making some more in the future. <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/pedals/schematics.html">This</a> is a great resource.

		I have since worked on a looper pedal. It worked by first amplifying the analog signal then recording it to an sd card on an Arduino. Buttons triggered logic on the Arduino to replay sounds. I was following similar techniques to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Vocal-Effects-Box/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Audio-Input/">this</a>.
	</div>		

	<div class="text highlight">
		Unfortunately, it didn’t work out because the Arduino created too much noise when it read from an wrote to the SD card. This could be fixed in the future by creating the circuit on a proper PCB as opposed to a breadboard.
