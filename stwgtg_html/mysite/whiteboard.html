		My old apartment had a full wall whiteboard. I had some spare robotics parts lying around at the time so I thought Iâ€™d try to build something fun.

		The printer consists of two stepper motors at the top two corners of your drawing surface connected by spools to a marker in the middle. By carefully controlling how the motors spin, you can move the marker around the board and draw. An arduino accepts commands from a python program and drives the steppers though a stepper driver circuit.
	</div>

	<div class="text highlight">
		I wrote two python programs for the printer. The first simply typed text and the second converted a bitmap image to a sequence of lines that could print out an approximation of the picture. This involved a mixture of edge detection and density detection.
