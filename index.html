<!-- ABOUT -->

<div class="text">
  Hi there, my name is Phil Isaac and this is my website.

  A little bit about myself: I am just finishing up studying engineering physics at the University of Toronto and co-running a startup company called PheedLoop, also in Toronto.

  I spent a few years living in Vancouver a while ago and can't wait to move back. In my spare time I tend to build things with software and hardware, play ultimate frisbee, bike around, read stuff, cook, and homebrew.

  I made this site because there are a few projects that I wanted to get online. Many of these projects are still in developement but you can check out how they're coming along below. If you think anything is cool and are interested in collaborating, get in touch.
